# Minervina et al. mild COVID-19 longitudinal TCRseq dataset
This repostitory contains procesed TCRalpha and TCRbeta repertoire datasets (and some results as well) for the paper by Minervina et al. on mild COVID-19,  [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08290),[bioxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.18.100545v1).

## Putatively COVID-19 reactive TCRbeta and TCRalpha sequences
Two groups of TCR clones with active dynamics post-infection were identified for both donors: 

_contracting_ clones are clones contracting in the repertoire from day 15 to day 45 post-infection. 

_expanding_ clones go up from day 15 to day 37 post-infection. 

Both groups were identified with edgeR (FDR-adjusted p<0.01, log2FC threshold=2). Clone counts are given as in first replicate of PBMC on day 15 (for _contracting_) and day 37 (for _expanding_ group).
